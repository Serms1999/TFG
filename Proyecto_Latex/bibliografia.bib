@inproceedings{aksoy2019automated,
	abstract = {IoT devices have been gaining popularity and become integral to our daily life. These devices are prone to be compromised as well as any computing system, but lack computing capabilities for cybersecurity software. An important measure for protecting attacks on IoT devices is through isolation of such devices by restriction of communications to the device from firewall/gateway. To this end identification of the IoT device is valuable for network administration and security. In this paper, we introduce a system for automated classification of device characteristics, called System IDentifier (SysID), based on their network traffic. SysID uses any single packet that is originated from the device to detect its kind. We use genetic algorithm (GA) to determine relevant features in different protocol headers and then deploy various machine learning (ML) algorithms (i.e., DecisionTable, J48 Decision Trees, OneR, and PART) to classify host device types by analyzing features selected by GA. GA helps reduce classification complexity and increases its accuracy by eliminating noisy features from the data. SysID allows the ability to have a completely automated way of classifying IoT devices using their TCP/IP packets without expert input for classification. In an experimental study with 23 IoT devices, SysID identified the device type from a single packet with over 95% accuracy.},

In this paper, we present a wireless device identification platform to improve Internet of things (IoT) security using deep learning techniques. Deep learning is a promising method for obtaining the characteristics of the different RF devices through learning from their RF data. Specifically, three different deep learning models, namely Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are considered here to identify wireless devices and distinguish among wireless devices from the same manufacture. As a case study, large data sets of RF traces from six “identical” ZigBee devices are collected using a USRP based test bed. We captured RF data across a wide range of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels to guarantee the resilience of our proposed models to variety of wireless channel conditions in practical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate high accuracy of deep learning methods for wireless device identification that potentially could enhance IoT security.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/MILCOM.2018.8599826},  ISSN={2155-7586},  month={Oct},}

	abstract = {Commonly used identifiers for IEEE 802.11 access points (APs), such as network name (SSID), MAC, or IP address can be easily spoofed. This allows an attacker to fake a real AP and intercept, collect, or alter (potentially even encrypted) data. In this paper, we address the aforementioned problem by studying limits of unique remote physical device identification based on their clock skew - an unavoidable phenomenon that causes clocks to run at marginal but measurably different speed. To this end, we propose an algorithm for passive fingerprinting using timestamps regularly sent by APs in beacon frames. The major advantages of our method are that it is online and that we are able to eliminate the influence of clock skew of the measurement device. Hence, fingerprints performed by different devices become comparable. We calculate the precision of our clock skew measurement algorithm and provide a termination criterion for estimation of the clock skew with arbitrary precision. Moreover, conducting a large scale evaluation, we study the stability and uniqueness of clock skew as a means for remote wireless device identification.},

Radio frequency (RF) fingerprint recognition technology as an important non-password authentication technology attracts more and more attention, because of its full use of radio frequency characteristics that cannot be imitated to achieve certification. In this paper, a RF fingerprint identification method based on dimensional reduction and machine learning is proposed as a component of intrusion detection for resolving authentication security issues. We compare three kinds of dimensional reduction methods, which are the traditional PCA, RPCA and KPCA. And we take random forests, support vector machine, artificial neural network and grey correlation analysis into consideration to make decisions on the dimensional reduction data. Finally, we obtain the recognition system with the best performance. Using a combination of RPCA and random forests, we achieve 90{\%} classification accuracy is achieved at SNR {\$}{\$}{\backslash}ge {\$}{\$} 10 dB when reduced dimension is 76.

Developing effective methods for intrusion detection, therefore, is an urgent task for assuring computer \& information system security. Since most attacks and misuses can be recognized through the examination of system audit log files and pattern analysis therein, an approach for intrusion detection can be built on them. First we have made deep analysis on attacks and misuses patterns in log files; and then proposed an approach using support vector machines for anomaly detection. It is a one-class SVM based approach, trained with abstracted user audit logs data from 1999 DARPA.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/ICMLC.2003.1260106},  ISSN={},  month={Nov},}

This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and random forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/ICDM.2008.17},  ISSN={2374-8486},  month={Dec},}

abstract = {Outlier detection, also named as anomaly detection, is one of the hot issues in the field of data mining. As well-known outlier detection algorithms, Isolation Forest(iForest) and Local Outlier Factor(LOF) have been widely used. However, iForest is only sensitive to global outliers, and is weak in dealing with local outliers. Although LOF performs well in local outlier detection, it has high time complexity. To overcome the weaknesses of iForest and LOF, a two-layer progressive ensemble method for outlier detection is proposed. It can accurately detect outliers in complex datasets with low time complexity. This method first utilizes iForest with low complexity to quickly scan the dataset, prunes the apparently normal data, and generates an outlier candidate set. In order to further improve the pruning accuracy, the outlier coefficient is introduced to design a pruning threshold setting method, which is based on outlier degree of data. Then LOF is applied to further distinguish the outlier candidate set and get more accurate outliers. The proposed ensemble method takes advantage of the two algorithms and concentrates valuable computing resources on the key stage. Finally, a large number of experiments are carried out to verify the ensemble method. The results show that compared with the existing methods, the ensemble method can significantly improve the outlier detection rate and greatly reduce the time complexity.},

These applications require higher data-rates, large bandwidth, increased capacity, low latency and high throughput. In light of these emerging concepts, IoT has revolutionized the world by providing seamless connectivity between heterogeneous networks (HetNets). The eventual aim of IoT is to introduce the plug and play technology providing the end-user, ease of operation, remotely access control and configurability. This paper presents the IoT technology from a bird's eye view covering its statistical/architectural trends, use cases, challenges and future prospects. The paper also presents a detailed and extensive overview of the emerging 5G-IoT scenario. Fifth Generation (5G) cellular networks provide key enabling technologies for ubiquitous deployment of the IoT technology. These include carrier aggregation, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), massive-MIMO (M-MIMO), coordinated multipoint processing (CoMP), device-to-device (D2D) communications, centralized radio access network (CRAN), software-defined wireless sensor networking (SD-WSN), network function virtualization (NFV) and cognitive radios (CRs). This paper presents an exhaustive review for these key enabling technologies and also discusses the new emerging use cases of 5G-IoT driven by the advances in artificial intelligence, machine and deep learning, ongoing 5G initiatives, quality of service (QoS) requirements in 5G and its standardization issues. Finally, the paper discusses challenges in the implementation of 5G-IoT due to high data-rates requiring both cloud-based platforms and IoT devices based edge computing.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2970118},  ISSN={2169-3536},  month={},}

More and more user-friendly, easy-to-pilot aerial and terrestrial drones are available off the shelf, and people can even remotely pilot them using their smartphones.

With this motivation, after a survey of the existing solutions, we propose a WiFi-based approach aimed at detecting nearby aerial or terrestrial devices by performing statistical fingerprint analysis on wireless traffic. This novel detection technique, tested in a variety of real-life scenarios, proved able to efficiently detect and identify intruder drones in all the considered experimental setups, making it a promising unmanned aerial vehicle detection approach in the framework of amateur drone surveillance.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/MCOM.2018.1700340},  ISSN={1558-1896},  month={April},}

In this paper, under the context of 5G communication, we propose an efficient physical layer identity spoofing attack detection scheme for IoT. By harnessing the sparsity of the virtual channel in mmWave and Massive MIMO 5G communication, we propose a two- step detection scheme. In the first step, our scheme detects anomalies by examining the virtual angles of arrival (AoA) and path gains of all the IoT devices simultaneously in a virtual channel space (VCS). In the second step, we introduce a machine learning based detection scheme to detect the actual attack. Simulation results evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of the proposed detection scheme. The minimum Bayes risk of the proposed scheme can be less than 0.5\% even in the presence of 100 IoT devices.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8647707},  ISSN={2576-6813},  month={Dec},}

Accordingly, certain reviews and surveys have been presented, focusing on disparate IoT-related domains, including IoT security, intrusion detection systems, and emerging technologies. However, in this article, we solely target IoT security with respect to product lifecycle stages. In that regard, we provide a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art surveys in an initial phase which concentrate on distinct parameters required for IoT security. Further, we present prominent solutions for addressing product lifecycle security in IoT. In this context, the contributions of this article are: (a) IoT product lifecycle security, (b) security taxonomy in IoT product lifecycle, (c) security solutions for each lifecycle phase in product lifecycle stages, and (d) open issues in these lifecycle stages that pose new research challenges.

SVMs are one of the most powerful and robust classification and regression algorithms in multiple fields of application. The SVM has been playing a significant role in pattern recognition which is an extensively popular and active research area among the researchers. Research in some fields where SVMs do not perform well has spurred development of other applications such as SVM for large data sets, SVM for multi classification and SVM for unbalanced data sets. Further, SVM has been integrated with other advanced methods such as evolve algorithms, to enhance the ability of classification and optimize parameters. SVM algorithms have gained recognition in research and applications in several scientific and engineering areas. This paper provides a brief introduction of SVMs, describes many applications and summarizes challenges and trends. Furthermore, limitations of SVMs will be identified. The future of SVMs will be discussed in conjunction with further applications. The applications of SVMs will be reviewed as well, especially in the some fields.}
