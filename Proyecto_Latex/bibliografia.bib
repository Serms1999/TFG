@inproceedings{aksoy2019automated,
	abstract = {IoT devices have been gaining popularity and become integral to our daily life. These devices are prone to be compromised as well as any computing system, but lack computing capabilities for cybersecurity software. An important measure for protecting attacks on IoT devices is through isolation of such devices by restriction of communications to the device from firewall/gateway. To this end identification of the IoT device is valuable for network administration and security. In this paper, we introduce a system for automated classification of device characteristics, called System IDentifier (SysID), based on their network traffic. SysID uses any single packet that is originated from the device to detect its kind. We use genetic algorithm (GA) to determine relevant features in different protocol headers and then deploy various machine learning (ML) algorithms (i.e., DecisionTable, J48 Decision Trees, OneR, and PART) to classify host device types by analyzing features selected by GA. GA helps reduce classification complexity and increases its accuracy by eliminating noisy features from the data. SysID allows the ability to have a completely automated way of classifying IoT devices using their TCP/IP packets without expert input for classification. In an experimental study with 23 IoT devices, SysID identified the device type from a single packet with over 95% accuracy.},

In this paper, we present a wireless device identification platform to improve Internet of things (IoT) security using deep learning techniques. Deep learning is a promising method for obtaining the characteristics of the different RF devices through learning from their RF data. Specifically, three different deep learning models, namely Deep Neural Network (DNN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are considered here to identify wireless devices and distinguish among wireless devices from the same manufacture. As a case study, large data sets of RF traces from six “identical” ZigBee devices are collected using a USRP based test bed. We captured RF data across a wide range of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) levels to guarantee the resilience of our proposed models to variety of wireless channel conditions in practical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate high accuracy of deep learning methods for wireless device identification that potentially could enhance IoT security.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/MILCOM.2018.8599826},  ISSN={2155-7586},  month={Oct},}

@inproceedings{lanze2012clock,
	abstract = {Commonly used identifiers for IEEE 802.11 access points (APs), such as network name (SSID), MAC, or IP address can be easily spoofed. This allows an attacker to fake a real AP and intercept, collect, or alter (potentially even encrypted) data. In this paper, we address the aforementioned problem by studying limits of unique remote physical device identification based on their clock skew - an unavoidable phenomenon that causes clocks to run at marginal but measurably different speed. To this end, we propose an algorithm for passive fingerprinting using timestamps regularly sent by APs in beacon frames. The major advantages of our method are that it is online and that we are able to eliminate the influence of clock skew of the measurement device. Hence, fingerprints performed by different devices become comparable. We calculate the precision of our clock skew measurement algorithm and provide a termination criterion for estimation of the clock skew with arbitrary precision. Moreover, conducting a large scale evaluation, we study the stability and uniqueness of clock skew as a means for remote wireless device identification.},

	abstract = {The access security of wireless devices is a serious challenge in present wireless network security. Radio frequency (RF) fingerprint recognition technology as an important non-password authentication technology attracts more and more attention, because of its full use of radio frequency characteristics that cannot be imitated to achieve certification. In this paper, a RF fingerprint identification method based on dimensional reduction and machine learning is proposed as a component of intrusion detection for resolving authentication security issues. We compare three kinds of dimensional reduction methods, which are the traditional PCA, RPCA and KPCA. And we take random forests, support vector machine, artificial neural network and grey correlation analysis into consideration to make decisions on the dimensional reduction data. Finally, we obtain the recognition system with the best performance. Using a combination of RPCA and random forests, we achieve 90{\%} classification accuracy is achieved at SNR {\$}{\$}{\backslash}ge {\$}{\$} 10 dB when reduced dimension is 76.

abstract = {ZigBee is a standard based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for wireless personal networks. This standard allows for the creation of very lost cost and low power networks - these applications run for years rather than months. These networks are created from sensors and actuators and can wireless control many electrical products such as remote controls, medical, industrial, and security sensors. Hundreds of companies are creating applications including Mitsubishi, Motorola, Freescale, and Siemens. This book is written for engineers who plan to develop ZigBee applications and networks, to understand how they work, and to evaluate this technology to see if it is appropriate to a particular project. This book does not simply state facts but explains what ZigBee can do through detailed code examples.
